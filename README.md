Scan2LoD3: Our method reconstructs detailed semantic 3D building models; Its backbone is laser raysâ€™ physics providing geometrical cues enhancing semantic segmentation accuracy.

**AFTER scan2lod3: LoD3**

Our approach to visibility analysis:
![](https://github.com/OloOcki/scan2lod3/blob/main/img/rayCasting.gif)
Visibility analysis using laser scanning observations and 3D models on a voxel grid. The ray is traced from the sensor position si to the hit point pi. 
The voxel is: empty if the ray traverses it; occupied when it contains pi; unknown if unmeasured; confirmed when occupied voxel intersects with vector plane; and conflicted when the plane intersects with an empty voxel.



## Implementation overview

The implementation can be divided into several steps:
1. Ray casting (C++) 
2. Bayesian network, fusion (R)
